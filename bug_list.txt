- When dragging a piece and releasing outside the chess board, piece disappears and is gone forever
- (FIXED) Pawns on far right get index out of range errors due to therm checking non existing tiles to the right
for some reason this is nto a problem on far left
- (FIXED) Pawns need to have kill available tiles seperated from move available tiles because king movement logic cannot differentiate between them
- (FIXED) Guard status will not go away after a piece is not being guarded
- (FIXED) Index out of range error for king
- (FIXED) Pawns sometimes aren't marked as guarded when they actually are
- (PARTIAL FIX - Used a bandaid fix by separating the function into 2 private ones so the parameters cannot get mixed up for weird reasons)
Strangest bug where somehow half the time the available_moves parameter for check_out_of_range_moves is the one for enemy knights
