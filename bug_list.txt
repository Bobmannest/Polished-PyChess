- When dragging a piece and releasing outside the chess board, piece disappears and is gone forever
- (FIXED) Pawns on far right get index out of range errors due to therm checking non existing tiles to the right
for some reason this is nto a problem on far left
- (FIXED) Pawns need to have kill available tiles seperated from move available tiles because king movement logic cannot differentiate between them
- Guard status will nto go away after e piece is not being guarded
