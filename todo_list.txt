DONE 1) Restrict piece movement depending on the type of piece

DONE 2) Restrict piece movement depending on the type of piece AND if there are any other pieces blocking the way
(except knight ofc)

DONE 3) Allow pieces to be taken by others so detect if other target piece on the target tile is an enemy piece

DONE extra) Let taking enemy pieces be shown as a visual when dragging a piece

DONE 4) Pawns need more complex logic unlike the other pieces!

DONE extra) king and knight cannot take opponent pieces so modify their function to do so

DONE 5) Add king logic that takes into consideration all other pieces' available moves so king cant go to a tile which he
can die to

6) Add actual turns

7) Add pawn conversion choice when they reach the end and pawns get to go up 2 pieces on their first turn

8) Add win condition and other misc features like the ability to move pawns up 2 spaces at the first movement

DONE optional) Add a marking system so every friendly piece that is guarded is marked and marked pieces cannot be taken by
king next turn because if king does it will be check

NOT HAPPENING) one king takes other king moves into anti check consideration
